SOFTWARE ENGINEERING BOOTCAMP at Flatiron School - Phase 1 Project 

Created by Angel & Bernard 

WHAT WE DO: 
Bad Takes is a music review blog where anybody can voice their opinion on any song without being censored. Aside from creating a safe space where people can talk about music, another goal of ours is to build a community for music critics, artists and fans can interact with each other. 

FUNCTIONALITY: 
- All music that has been reviewed will be displayed by their album cover
- A user can click on that image where the following information can be displayed: 
    - song title
    - artist name
    - SoundCloud player 
    - music reviews 
- The user can also add in their reviews by submitting their thoughts in the first form
- They also have the ability to add in a song to the website with the required information and include their take on the song that they want to add
